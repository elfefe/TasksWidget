*New task added*

The date will be **red** if it’s due for today, **yellow** if the date is passed, and **black** for a later due date.

The blank space at the right of the date is a text field to input the task title.

The white space below the task title is a text field to input the task description.

*Task with a description and a title*

The icon on the right indicates if the task is done (![done](./medias/check_24dp_0ED600_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg)) or not (![undone](./medias/close_24dp_EA3323_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg)).

If this icon is clicked the task will be removed from the active tasks. Clicking on the ![history](./medias/unpublished_24dp_999999_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg) icon will show the history of all the tasks.

If you want to hide all the descriptions to see more tasks, click the ![description](./medias/notes_24dp_999999_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg) icon.

To search through your tasks click the ![search](./medias/search_24dp_999999_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg) icon.

*Reduced app*

The ![reduce](./medias/arrow_drop_up_24dp_999999_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg) icon reduces TasksWidget to a less invasive format.

The ![hide](./medias/exit_to_app_24dp_999999_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg) icon hides TasksWidget in the system trail bar.

The ![location](./medias/location_on_24dp_999999_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz24.svg) icon allows you to move the app horizontally across the window.
